## Title
Instant README Generator
## Description
This application is a command line application that will generate a high quality professional README file for a new application build. The inspiration for building this project is the desire to reduce the amount of time spent on compiling a README file. This application was built using JavaScript working with node.Js. In this project I was able to gain more hands on experince with node.Js and building with JavaScript in general.
